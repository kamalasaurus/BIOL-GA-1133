    "I highly recommend watching this series by 3blue1brown to get a sense of what matrix operations are from a vector space perspective and how to visualize them: [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) .  So far, we will cover the first 4 videos in the series, the rest are enrichment ...or review if you've already done statistics.  We might cover topics like convolution and polynomial multiplication when we get to deep learning, which are a bit different from the vector representation of matrices.  The foundation you build here will be helpful then.\n",
